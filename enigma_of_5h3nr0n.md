So I downloaded the file that is given and it is opening for some purpose.. I saw that the type of file is compiled python file.. So I used online decompiler and got the python file.. There is some code in it.. Manish annayya told me that there are 3 parts in this task and that I completed the first one and asked me to read the description properly.. It says to find the hidden text function and find the image.. It took some time for me to understand the code and after reading the code, I found that there are 2 functions with almost the same name.. I told manish annayya about this and he said "This is a python file..Remember that you can edit it..",, Then my dumb brain got that and I interchanged the names of the functions.. The next part is pure reversing.. There are three parts of the key and the concatinated key.. After finding them and entering them, we get a link leading us to an image which reveals the flag..
