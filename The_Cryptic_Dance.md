#The_Cryptic_Dance

This is the first task I did.. It is pretty obvious that each of the dance symbol represents an alphabet.. I searched "dancing symbols".. I found that those symbols are called "dancing men in cipher".. Then I started finding similar images that were given in the task and their corresponding alphabets.. Finally they led me to a meaningful message and that's the flag..
