#KeyCode_Mystique

-It took 4 to 5 days for me to solve this task.. There is a code and I tried all the ways to decode it.. I was tired of all these and texted manish annayya that anything isn't working.. He told me not to use soo much brain for this.. I didn't get it at the beginning.. I was dumb founded.. And he asked me to read the description properly.. I read the description and the only hint that lies in it seems to be keyboard.. I looked at my laptop's keyboard and all the letters are nearer to each other.. When I looked closely, all the letters seems to be enclosing a paritcular letter.. Doing so, I finally go tthe flag..
