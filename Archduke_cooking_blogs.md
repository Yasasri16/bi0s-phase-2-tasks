I was given the link to a website which is supposed to be recipe book.. I checked the whole website and found no clue.. Then I googled "How to find hidden files or information in a website".. It gave me a command "dirb".. Then I used "dirb http://4.213.89.50:8000" and found two hidden links.. Flag is in one of them..
